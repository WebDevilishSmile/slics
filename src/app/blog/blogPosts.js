That's why I don't pull trailers that I deem hazardous and I don't use tractors that have major issues. It's easy to get caught in the go-go-go mentally and overlook important details. If something looks or feels off, then I ask a mechanic. Those guys are cool and its their job. I have never gone to the mechanic and been told they couldn't help me. I went there once and thought something was wrong with a tractor and I was wrong. The mechanic and I had a laugh about it and off I went.`,

And to be honest, I've asked some DUMB questions. Regardless of how insanely naive I must have sounded, I only have to ask that stupid question once. What I do now is I preface the question with, "Don't laugh at me if I sound like a dumbass, but... what does the red hose do?". Don't be afraid to ask a dumb question, it could end up saving your life or at the very least it will teach you something. Be curious.`,
